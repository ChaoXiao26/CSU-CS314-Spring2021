  ## Team Charter
  
  We the team members of 404-Brain Not Found have agreed on the following to guide our interactions throughout the semester. We have all agreed that the goal of this team is to succeed and for everyone to get an A in the course. We recognize the differences amongst our team members and choose to work through them with cooperation and respect. We strive to make each other better and to help each other overcome any personal deficiencies. We hope to keep each other engaged and foster an environment in which we all feel encouraged to voice our opinions. 

We expect to deal with many challenges throughout the semester. We have a very diverse team with varying levels of professional and technical experience. To facilitate our success, we have decided to meet every Monday after class and to have other meetings as required. Our main medium of communication will be through the use of slack and teams. 

During our meetings we will work together to formulate a plan for the work that we need to get done. We expect each other to turn in our contributions on time and to ask for help as needed. We will be updating the team on our individual progress throughout the Sprint and check in with each other often enough so that missed commitments aren't large and difficult to address when they occur. If someone falls behind, we as a team will find a way to get the work done and help our teammate succeed. In this case, we should be gracious, but also hold them accountable.
