  ## Team Charter
  
  We the team members of 404-Brain Not Found have agreed on the following to guide our interactions throughout the semester. We have all agreed that the goal of this team is to succeed and for everyone to get an A in the course. We recognize the differences amongst our team members and choose to work through them with cooperation and respect. We strive to make each other better and to help each other overcome any personal deficiencies. We hope to keep each other engaged and foster an environment in which we all feel encouraged to voice our opinions. 

We expect to deal with many challenges throughout the semester. We have a very diverse team with varying levels of professional and technical experience. To facilitate our success, we have decided to meet every Monday after class and to have other meetings as required. Our main medium of communication will be through the use of slack and teams. 

During our meetings we will work together to formulate a plan for the work that we need to get done. We expect each other to turn in our contributions on time and to ask for help as needed. We will be updating the team on our individual progress throughout the Sprint and check in with each other often enough so that missed commitments aren't large and difficult to address when they occur. If someone falls behind, we as a team will find a way to get the work done and help our teammate succeed. In this case, we should be gracious, but also hold them accountable.

We have agreed that it is acceptable for team members to take on a wider set of tasks for the sake of the success of the team. We will all strive to put a similar amount of effort into every assignment. However, at certain times we may rely more heavily on different team members for more specific tasks. We will divide the workload based on the preferences and skills of team members. We will strive for everyone to get an equal chance to contribute and grow their skills. 

We acknowledge we might not all be able to work on the tasks we prefer, but all opinions should be valued and recognized during the planning process. We need to communicate and set clear expectations for what is required. We are committed to writing quality code that is readable for everyone on the team. We shall follow the guidelines and work through any problems that come up. Project changes that involve altering the code in a way that was not discussed should be run by the team first. Small changes needed to make the design work are ok as long as they don’t deviate from the design too much or break other code. Any friction that might arise will be addressed openly with the team members involved. We ought to treat each other with respect and understanding throughout the length of the project.
